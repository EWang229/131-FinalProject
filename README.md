Hello everyone!

My project focuses on the potability, or drinkability, of water based on thousands of observation of water samples. More information in the .html file.

Note: I performed everything in the rmd file, so no extra R scripts were needed. 
The data folder contain two subfolders, processed and unprocessed. The processed subfolder contains the processed data and the codebook, while the unprocessed folder contains 
the raw data.

Enjoy!
